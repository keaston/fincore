fincore
-------

fincore is a quick and dirty utility to show how much of a file is resident in
the page cache.  It was developed on Linux but may work on other kernels that
provide the mincore() system call.

Usage
-----

fincore [-b] <filename> [filename...]

By default it will show the percentage of the file's pages that are resident.
If the -b switch is supplied, it will instead show the number of bytes (if the
file size is not a multiple of the system page size, this could be greater
than the file size).
